 <h2> About Benjamin</h2>
<p> <strong>"Start by doing what is necessary,then what is possible, 
and suddenly you are doing the impossible"- A Quote that 
Benjamin really loves.</strong> Benjamin is a computer science junior at Alcorn State University.
His purpose is to be able to create things from imagination and leverage technology to solve problems that affect people across the 
globe. His dream is to impact people positively and help change the world. He believes he can achieve all his goals through team-work, consistency, 
hard work, and determination.
Benjamin has always loved technology and is always catching up on new technologies. He has a strong passion for learning and is constantly 
increasing his expertise in Product Management, Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and many others. This passion has motivated and 
driven his growth both academically and professionally. 
In all, Benjamin is a technology lover, a person who converts imagination to realty, and a problem solver. So since Benjamin is a problem solver, 
he is constantly looking for things to challenge him academically and professionally. When Benjamin is not working, he is either catching up on YouTube videos about new tech or watching a show on Netflix and if feeling
really excited, he is probably looking for things to dissemble and assemble.
Oh before he forgets, Benjamin is also open to new opportunities so please 
reach out to him. His email is benawobotu@gmail.com so please contact him a
nd begin something exciting.</p>
